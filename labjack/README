In order to get the Labjack library installed correctly on your machine make
sure that the scripts in the driver/ directory are executable:

chmod +x install_driver.sh run_driver.sh

And then run these commands in the driver/ directory:

make
./install_driver.sh
./run_driver.sh

This should get the Labjack driver installed correctly. Then you need to run
make in this directory to build the labjack library. After that you can link
against the labjack library and build your own code with the ability to use
the functions in that library.

To email this library using gmail the scripts have to be non-executable is the
reason for the first commands.
