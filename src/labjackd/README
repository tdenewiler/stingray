In order for labjackd to actually shutdown the computer the binary has to have
root privileges. To do this you have to give the user that is running the binary
temporary root privileges. Every time you rebuild labjackd you have to run
these two commands:
    sudo chown root labjackd
    sudo chmod 4755 labjackd
