To compile all the libraries and the executables run "make" in this directory.

To clean all the libraries and the executables run "make clean" in this
directory.

To have the Labjack library build correctly go see the README file in
libs/labjack/.

To build the code the following packages are required:
	g++
	libgtk2.0-0
	libgtk2.0-common
	libgtk2.0-dev
	libgtk2.0-0-dbg
	libgnome2-0
	libgnome2-common
	libgnome2-dev
	libcv1
	libhighgui1
	libcvaux1
	libcv-dev
	libcvaux-dev
	libhighgui-dev

And the following packages are recommended:
	libgtk2.0-doc
	libgnome2-doc
	opencv-doc

To install packages you must have apt set up correctly. There is an example
sources.list file that contains the repositories where packages can be
downloaded from in this directory. This sources.list file uses repositories for
the Ubuntu Intrepid (8.10) release. To change it for a different release
replace all instances of "intrepid" to your release (for example, hardy). To
make a backup of your current sources and use these instead open a terminal and
run these commands from the current directory:
	sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak
	sudo cp sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list

To retrieve a list of all available packages and upgrade your system to use the
most current versions use the command:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

To install packages use the command:
	sudo apt-get install <package1> <package2> ... <packageN>
