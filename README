This software has been tested using Ubuntu Linux and has been found to run correctly from verion
8.04 and newer.

To have the Labjack library build correctly go see the README file in the labjack/ directory.

To build the code the following packages are required:
	g++
	cmake
	libgtk2.0-0
	libgtk2.0-common
	libgtk2.0-dev
	libgtk2.0-0-dbg
	libglade2-dev
	libcv1
	libhighgui1
	libcvaux1
	libcv-dev
	libcvaux-dev
	libhighgui-dev

And the following packages are recommended:
	libgtk2.0-doc
	opencv-doc
	geany
	manpages
	manpages-dev
	manpages-posix-dev

Here is a single command that can be copied and pasted into a terminal that will make sure all of
the required and recommended packages are installed:

sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libgtk2.0-0 libgtk2.0-common libgtk2.0-dev libgtk2.0-0-dbg libcv1 libhighgui1 libcvaux1 libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev libgtk2.0-doc opencv-doc geany manpages manpages-dev manpages-posix-dev libglade2-dev

For CMake to build using the OpenCV libraries it needs to know how to find the OpenCV libraries. It
is necessary to download the file FindOpenCV.cmake from
http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Getting_started
and copy it into /usr/share/cmake-2.6/Modules/. There is also a copy of the FindOpenCV.cmake file
included in this repository. Note that depending on your system the version number of cmake may be
slightly different but cmake-2.6 is the minimum version that is required when building the code in
this repository (as defined in the CMakeLists.txt file).

Similarly, for Gtk-2.0 it is necessary to download FindGTK2.cmake from
http://cmake-modules.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Modules/GTK2/FindGTK2.cmake
and copy that into the same directory. A separate copy is included in this repository.

To compile all the libraries and the executables run `cmake .' and then `make' in this directory.

To clean all the libraries and the executables run `make clean' in this directory.

All of the libaries are built in the lib/ directory and all of the executables are built in the bin/
directory. There is a script that will run all of the programs necessary for the Stingray to
operate which can be started in a terminal using the command `./startStingray'.

Note that all of the executables should be run from the top-level directory and that is where the
startStingray script is located. The thing to be careful about is that the GUI must be run from this
same directory using the command `bin/gui' to start it. The reason for this is that the executables
are set to search for their configuration files relative to the top-level directory and are unable
to find them if the command to start the programs is invoked from a different directory.
